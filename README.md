## Customization

### Update Ticket Booking Links

Edit `/components/CompactEvent.tsx` and update the `bookingLink` property for each ticket tier:

```typescript
const ticketTiers: TicketTier[] = [
  { name: "Bronze", price: "â‚¹2,100", bookingLink: "YOUR_BOOKING_LINK_HERE", icon: Award, soldOut: false },
  // ... update other tiers
];
```

### Mark Passes as Sold Out

To mark a pass as sold out, change `soldOut: false` to `soldOut: true`:

```typescript
const ticketTiers: TicketTier[] = [
  { name: "Bronze", price: "â‚¹2,100", bookingLink: "#", icon: Award, soldOut: true }, // This pass is sold out
  // ... other tiers
];
```

When sold out:
- A red "Sold Out" badge appears
- The card becomes semi-transparent
- The button changes to disabled "Sold Out"
- Hover effects are disabled

See `CONFIGURATION.md` for detailed configuration instructions.
